Hello Amazing Personality,

I’m FREDRICK FAVOUR (Nzekwe Okenna Favour).

I am on a mission to find my friend.

12 years ago, I had a deaf-mute friend who was the son of our next door neighbour. He would often cry to express his sad or angry feelings, similarly he does smile when happy or enjoying a company. At the eve of christmas in year 2010 during the eve's party, we lost my friend and since 12 years ago no one was able to find him neither could the police and detectives fathom a trace of him. Where could he have been?

I wish my friend had a voice that could be heard...

I carved his audience,

I wish he was able to hear and listen...

I MISS HIM!


Now, you are the friend I am presently seeking to find. 

Here's what I do!

I give you the voice to speak to your audience, and secure you the attention you deserve in the digital space and beyond through content writing, quality copywriting, social media management, search engine optimization, and excellent digital marketing services.

In a cognitive statement, I am a professional writer, digital marketing expert, content creator, entrepreneur, and a Web3 innovator.


I’m interested in innoavtions, learning new things and unwinding my creativity.

🌱 

I’m currently learning blockchain development, and further expanding my writing prowess as well digital mamangent skills.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on amazing technological innovations and be part of something incredible and creative.
